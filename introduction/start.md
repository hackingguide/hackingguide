# Starting off



## Questions 

* What is it used for?
* What for operating system is it running?
* Which version of the object is running?
* What for protocols is it using?
* How can you connect to it?
* What kind of hardware is needed for research?
  * Things to look out for when buying hardware

## Tips

* When buying hardware online from foreign countries expect longer delivery time
* Hardware that is bought online from untrusted source might not be as advertised
* Organize the attack as well as possible. Make a step-by-step plan, preliminary research and create an equal situation \(mocking\).
* As soon as you start carrying out the attack, carefully consider which attack you are carrying out first. Starting with a DDoS is not the most convenient.
* Try to determine different attack vectors based on real life situation.
