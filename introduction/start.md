  This is a general guide on how to start researching an unknown
  product/technology.
---

# Starting off

## **General steps**

* Literature study of the technology/product
* Usage of product
* Prepare scenarios
* Sort scenarios on real life situations
* Prioritize scenarios \(First passive attacks, DoS as last resort\)
* Work out the scenarios
* Evaluation

## **Questions**

* What is it used for?
* What kind of operating system is running on the product?
* Which firmware version is the object running on?
* What kind of protocols does it use?
* How can you connect to it?
* What kind of hardware is needed for research?
  * Things to look out for when buying hardware

## **Tips**

* When buying hardware online from foreign countries expect longer delivery time.
* Hardware that is bought online from an untrusted source might not be as advertised.
* Organize the attack as well as possible. Create a step-by-step plan, perform preliminary research and simulate a similar situation \(mocking\).
* As soon as you start carrying out the attack, carefully consider which attack you are carrying out first. Starting with a DDoS is not the most convenient.
* Try to determine different attack vectors based on real life situation.
