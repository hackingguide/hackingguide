  To enter a data center you will need to go through an electronic entrance
  gate. We have two of these at our disposal and have come up with different
  ways to hack it.

# Electronic entrance gate

## Attacking scenario's

* Power off the gate.
* Take out the side door, it only rests on 3 pins.
* If the reference number is stored on NFC, read and change reference number \(brute force\)
* Face recognition bypass with photo and or 3D simulation/animation
* Physically break open the gate
* Utilize a lockpick set.
* Intercept verification-request\(s\)
* Exploit Software vulnerabilities
* Social engineering: get the key to take off the roof panel\(PLC and electronics becomes exposed\)
* Unscrew the keyhole, this will open up the wiring
